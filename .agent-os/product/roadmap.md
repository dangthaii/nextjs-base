# Product Roadmap

> Last Updated: 2025-08-29
> Version: 1.0.0
> Status: Planning

## Phase 1: Multi-Device Authentication (MVP) (3-4 weeks)

**Goal:** Transform single-device JWT authentication into a robust multi-device session management system
**Success Criteria:** Users can login from multiple devices simultaneously with proper session management and security

### Must-Have Features

**Database Schema Enhancement (M: 1 week)**
- Create `UserSession` table with device fingerprinting, IP tracking, and session metadata
- Add indexes for performance on session lookups and cleanup
- Create database migration scripts for existing users
- Add cascade delete policies for user cleanup

**Multi-Device Session Management (L: 2 weeks)**
- Implement session-based authentication alongside existing JWT system
- Add device registration and fingerprinting for security
- Create session cleanup jobs for expired/inactive sessions
- Build session validation middleware with device verification
- Add concurrent session limits (configurable per deployment)

**Enhanced Auth API Endpoints (S: 2-3 days)**
- `/api/auth/sessions` - List active user sessions with device info
- `/api/auth/sessions/revoke` - Revoke specific or all sessions
- `/api/auth/sessions/current` - Get current session details
- Update existing login/logout to handle session creation/destruction

**Security Hardening (S: 2-3 days)**
- Implement session rotation on login
- Add suspicious activity detection (location/device changes)
- Create rate limiting for auth endpoints
- Add CSRF protection for session management

## Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing Suite (2-3 weeks)

**Goal:** Build bulletproof testing coverage for all authentication features to ensure reliability and security
**Success Criteria:** 95%+ test coverage with comprehensive integration tests covering all auth flows

### Must-Have Features

**Backend Testing Infrastructure (M: 1 week)**
- Set up test database with automated seeding/cleanup
- Create authentication test utilities and factories
- Build mock services for external dependencies
- Configure CI/CD pipeline with test automation

**Unit Tests - Authentication Core (M: 1 week)**
- Test all auth utility functions (token generation, validation, encryption)
- Test middleware functions with various scenarios
- Test database models and relationships
- Test session management logic and cleanup functions

**Integration Tests - API Endpoints (M: 1 week)**
- Test complete auth flows: register → login → refresh → logout
- Test multi-device scenarios and session conflicts
- Test security scenarios: expired tokens, invalid sessions, brute force
- Test edge cases: concurrent logins, rapid logout/login, network failures

**Frontend Testing Suite (S: 2-3 days)**
- Test auth hooks and context providers
- Test protected route components and redirects
- Test auth form validations and error handling
- Test session persistence across page reloads

**Security & Performance Testing (S: 2-3 days)**
- Penetration testing for common auth vulnerabilities
- Load testing for auth endpoints under concurrent usage
- Memory leak testing for session storage
- Test session cleanup and garbage collection

## Phase 3: Template Polish & Documentation (2 weeks)

**Goal:** Transform the authentication system into a production-ready, well-documented template for other projects
**Success Criteria:** Template can be deployed and customized by other developers within 30 minutes

### Must-Have Features

**Developer Documentation (S: 2-3 days)**
- Complete setup guide with environment configuration
- Architecture documentation with database diagrams
- API reference with request/response examples
- Security best practices and deployment considerations

**Configuration & Customization (S: 2-3 days)**
- Environment-based configuration system
- Customizable session timeout and security policies
- Pluggable authentication providers (social login prep)
- Theme and UI customization examples

**Deployment Templates (M: 1 week)**
- Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Vercel/Netlify deployment configurations
- Database migration and seeding scripts for production

**Example Implementations (S: 2-3 days)**
- Sample user dashboard with session management
- Example protected routes and permission systems
- Integration examples with common third-party services
- Performance monitoring and logging setup

**Template Packaging (XS: 1 day)**
- Create template generator script
- Package template with sample data
- Version tagging and release preparation
- Template testing with fresh installations

### Success Metrics

- **Phase 1:** Multi-device login working with session management
- **Phase 2:** All tests passing with 95%+ coverage
- **Phase 3:** Template deployed successfully in under 30 minutes

### Technical Dependencies

- CockroachDB for session storage scaling
- Redis (optional) for session caching
- Testing frameworks: Vitest, Playwright, Jest
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions or similar
- Monitoring: Application performance monitoring integration
